# Initial Introduction
**2022-02-21** // Anzle Chavez

With this program, I'm planning to learn practical Rust and Git skills and actually use it, in the form of a flashcard program.

> *Included so far:*
- Structs and enums for cards
- Implementation of private structs
- Using Rust workspaces for both a Rust library backend and a (hopefully) React/rust-wasm frontend :)
